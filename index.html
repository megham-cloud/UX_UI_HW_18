                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am Megha Mahapatra, a budding mathematician turned UX/UI designer. I was drawn to mathematics for
                        the logical and analytical problems it presented, but I found my calling in UX/UI design since it
                        allows me to get creative while also solving problems analytically. </p>
                    <p>I absolutely enjoy stepping into the shoes of users in order to explore their world of thinking. I
                        also love the design thinking process for its encouragement of frequently testing solutions and
                        learning from our failures to produce even better designs backed in evidence.</p>
                    <p>My skills include executing the design thinking process by using tool such as Miro, Figma, Adobe XD,
                        and inVision.</p>

                <p>When I am not working on UX design, you can catch me gawking at the stars while strolling around the
                    neighborhood in the early evening. I also spend countless hours reading fantasy novels (I am
                    currently losing my mind over Brandon Sanderson's novels and I love it), and practicing the
                    keyboard.
